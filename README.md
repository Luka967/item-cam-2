# Item Cam 2
Follow an item as around your base like in the Factorio trailer. Spiritual successor to DaveMcW's Item Cam, rewritten for 2.0 and Space Age content support.

## Things it can follow right now
- Belts, splitters, undergrounds, any and all sideload configurations
- Mining drills, assemblers, furnaces (recyclers), etc. with resource/recipe that has some item output
- Inserters, chests, train cargo wagons
- Logistic bots picking up and delivering items
- Space Age content: rockets with cargo, space platform hubs and their pods

## Limitations
- Platform hubs/landing pads and chests with huge inventories might incur a UPS hit
- Inserters and mining drills shuffling items on ground can't be tracked

## Things that are planned to be trackable:
- Fluids in general - fluid wagons, pumps
- Crafting machines with recipes that have only fluid output
- Non-SA satellite's Space science pack output
- Loaders, linked belts, other modded content interactions as time goes
