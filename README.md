# Item Cam 2
Follow an item as around your base like in the Factorio trailer. Spiritual successor to DaveMcW's Item Cam, rewritten for 2.0 and eventual Space Age content support.

Things it can track right now:
- Belts, splitters, undergrounds, any and all sideload configurations
- Inserters
- Furnaces, assemblers, etc. with recipe that has some item output
- Chests, train wagons
- Bots picking up and delivering items
- Rockets, space platform hubs and their cargo pods

Things that are planned to be trackable:
- Mining drill with item output
- (Non-SA) Output from rocket
- Fluids in general - fluid wagons, pumps
- Crafting machine with recipe that has only fluid output
- Loaders, linked belts
